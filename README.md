Analysing National Electricity Market data:
1. Compiling data from the AEMO web site.
2. Looking at the impact of solar irradiance and temperature variation
3. Looking at time series plots to understand price volatility and operational demand patterns, espeically before and after the change to 5 minute settlement.

These are not directly considering market dynamics, which reflect inter-dependencies between energy markets (i.e. electricity, gas, coal) and carbon, environmental markets.
