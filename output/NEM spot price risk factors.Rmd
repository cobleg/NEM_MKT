## Introduction

This report presents results related to identifying the factors driving variation (i.e. risk) in spot prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM).

## Outline in this report

- Descriptive statistics showing the NEM spot price risk profile
- Exploring causal factors
- Drawing conclusions

## Data collection
Data sets were sourced from:

- [Australian Electricity Market Operator](https://aemo.com.au/)
- [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration via the worldMet library](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily)
- [NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER)](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/)

## Data notes

Time frame of data collection is 1 January 2021 to 28 February 2022, inclusive. Note that prior to 1 October 2021, the NEM data are reported in 30-minute market settlement intervals. After 1 October 2021, market settlement intervals changed to 5 minutes to match the 5-minute dispatch interval. Consequently, data after 1 October 2021 are aggregated to 30-minute.

NEM market data are confined to the New South Wales (NSW) region. A single weather station is used to associate variation in NEM spot price ($/MWh) and quantity (MWh) to variation in air temperature and solar irradiation.

## Summary statistics
Here is a table of the collated data set:
```{r, message = F}
library(kableExtra)
kable(table.1) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 10)
```

During market intervals that are within the 2.5% and the 97.5% percentile range, the spot price averages $60.73/MWh +/- $33.00/MWh and quantity averages 7,537.91 MWh +/- 1,134 MWh. Note that periods of very low prices, the average is negative and the quantity range is 5,795.48 MWh +/- 803.12 MWh. During percentile market intervals, price averages $658.29/MWh with an average range of +$1,072.17/MWh. 


## Histogram of NEM NSW spot price
Excluding outliers, here is a histogram of spot prices averaged over 30-minute intervals:

## Histogram of NEM NSW spot price spikes
NEM spot prices are prone to spikes to a minimum of -$1,000/MWh (price floor) and $15,000/MWh (price cap). Note that the histogram suggests pronounced skewness and peakiness.

## Probability Density Function (PDF)
Given the observed peakiness and skewness in NEM spot prices, it is useful to relate this to a particular PDF. Here, excluding outliers, spot price variation is compared to the gamma and log-normal PDFs.

## Price versus quantity
A scatter plot of quantity (MWh) and spot price ($/MWh) suggests a direct, albeit noisy, relationship:

## Seasonal patterns
Using a calendar plot, we can explore quantity variation over the whole of calendar year 2021:

## Air temperature and quantity
The demand for electricity suggests a seasonal cycle, which is partly influenced by seasonal air temperature variation:

## Solar irradiance and normal demand
Across three seasons, higher solar irradiance suggests lower spot prices:

## Risk of spikes in through the year
Price spikes appear to be spread across the winter months:

## Solar irradiance and demand during price spikes
This chart suggests that solar irradiance contributes to low percentile spot prices, but not to high percentile spot prices:

## Share of solar generation

- According to the AEMO's [NEM Registration and Exemption List](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/participant_information/nem-registration-and-exemption-list.xls?la=en) renewable electricity generation accounts for 55% of total generation. A relatively small proportion is solar power. However, [according to Energy NSW](https://www.energy.nsw.gov.au/renewables/renewable-generation/solar-energy), there is in excess of 4,000 MW of solar power capacity installed

## Summary
In summary:

- There is wide dispersion of NEM spot prices in the NEM region
- Air temperature and solar irradiance influences suggest a complex seasonal pattern
- Solar irradiance suppresses quantity (MWh) notably in autumn and spring.
- There is an association with low percentile spot prices and solar irradiance
- Most spot price spikes appear during the winter months
- No clear evidence of any time trend in price spikes
